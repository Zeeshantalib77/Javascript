Data validation is the process of ensuring that user input is clean, correct, and useful.

Typical validation tasks are:

1 - has the user filled in all required fields?
2 - has the user entered a valid date?
3 - has the user entered text in a numeric field?
4 - Most often, the purpose of data validation is to ensure correct user input.

Validation can be defined by many different methods, and deployed in many different ways.

1 - Server side validation: is performed by a web server, after input has been sent to the server.
2 - Client side validation: is performed by a web browser, before input is sent to a web server.

HTML5 introduced a new HTML validation concept called constraint validation.
