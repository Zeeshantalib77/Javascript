/*
Timing Events
=> The window object allows execution of code at specified time intervals.
=> These time intervals are called timing events.

The two key methods to use with JavaScript are:

1 - setTimeout(function, milliseconds)
Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.
2 - setInterval(function, milliseconds)
3 - setTimeout() but repeats the execution of the function continuously.
