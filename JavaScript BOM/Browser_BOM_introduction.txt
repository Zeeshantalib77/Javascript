The Browser Object Model (BOM)

1 - There are no official standards for the Browser Object Model (BOM).

2 - Since modern browsers have implemented (almost) the same methods and properties for JavaScript interactivity, it is often referred to, as methods and properties of the BOM.

Window Size
Two properties can be used to determine the size of the browser window.

=> Both properties return the sizes in pixels:

1 - window.innerHeight - the inner height of the browser window (in pixels)
2 - window.innerWidth - the inner width of the browser window (in pixels)

Other Window Methods

1 - window.open() - open a new window
2 - window.close() - close the current window
3 - window.moveTo() -move the current window
4 - window.resizeTo() -resize the current window

1 - screen.width
2 - screen.height
